# Face representation and similarity

This repo is used to extract feature of face image and compute similarity of two face images.
Feature extraction model is borrowed by [Do We Really Need to Collect Million of Faces for Effective Face Recognition?](https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2016_ECCV_1). We use the output of pool5 as our feature.
