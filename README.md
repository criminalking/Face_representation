# Face representation and similarity

This repo is used to extract feature of face image and compute similarity of two face images.
Feature extraction model is borrowed by [Do We Really Need to Collect Million of Faces for Effective Face Recognition?](https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2016_ECCV_1). We use the output of pool5 as our feature.

# Results


# Compare with other feature representation methods
Here are some other state-of-the-art methods:
- [LightCNN](https://github.com/AlfredXiangWu/LightCNN)
- [Facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)

Facenet is the best!


# TODO
